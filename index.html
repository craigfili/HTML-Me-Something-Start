         <p>After graduating from college, I packed my bags and set off
            to see the world and meet its people.  I wouldn't get my fill 
            for 12 years. Rather, I never got my fill, it was just time to
            come home and spend time with my loved ones. These were my stops:

               <h2>Georgia, Eastern Europe</h2>
               <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">My career as an English teacher started in 2010 in Georgia. Not that Georgia, but rather
                  the former Soviet Republic. The country sits on the Black Sea and is bordered by
                  mountains on the north and south. Its architecture is a fascinating mix of Soviet,
                   Orthodox, Persian, and Turkish. I was an absolute baby when I started, and this
                  was trial by fire, but it amounted to an incredible learning experience and the 
                  most interesting year of my life. I lived on a farm in a little hilltop village, with
                  only occasional access to the internet. We showered once a week. I spoke no Georgian(its own language family), and 
                  had only one colleague that spoke English. I lived with a Georgian family, and by the end of
                  year, I had become like a member of their family. It was amazing being with people
                  that know how to do and make almost everything from scratch. I participated in a grape harvest, made
                  wine with my feet, churned butter, made fresh cheese daily, milked a cow, sowed seeds, danced folk dances, 
                  and learned about a part of the world that I had known nothing about.

               <h2>Chile</h2>
               <p>Next, it was off to the southern tip of the world. I lived in a small town just north
                  of the island Chiloe, the gateway to Patagonia.  It was a land of volcanos, lakes, and lush
                  vegetation. A wet suit was a must as it literally rained for months at a time. 
                  You're never that far from the ocean in Chile, so the seafood was superb. This land afforded
                  the most beautiful backcountry camping I've ever done and it gave me my start in Spanish,
                  although, because of their strong accent, which is beautiful and songlike, it's a great place 
                  to practice, but not to learn as a beginner.
               </p>

               <h2>Castilla-La Mancha, Spain</h2>
               <p>My next stop brought me to the land of Don Quixote, and it looks straight out of Cervantes
                  with its hillstop windmills. I lived in small town there as well, surrounded by vineyards in
                  every direction for at least an hour drive, only broken up by the occasional olive grove. Again,
                  I lived in a place that very few people spoke English, unlike the big cities in Spain, and this 
                  allowed me to perfect my Spanish and acquire the Castillian accent that I have to this day. I fell
                  in love with the social lifestyle and laidback attitude, not to mention their wine and cheese.

               <h2>Kiev, Ukraine</h2>
               <p> My next choice of location turned out to be both a dissapointment and a blessing. I moved to Kiev in the
                  fall of 2013. I had been studying Russian since I had lived in Georgia (widely understood as a second language
                  there), and was finally seizing the opportunity to get my Russian on par with my Spanish. However, shortly after I arrived
                  the Maidan protests erupted and the country appeared to on the brink of civil war, a war that would eventually begin
                  in 2022. It was inspiring, if not extremely scary, to witness this momentous event, as Ukrainians rose up demanding a different
                  path for their country. However, it was not a great time to start a life there, so I moved back to Spain for the 
                  spring semester.  I had spent so much time and resources studying Russian, that it was devastating not to be able perfect it by living 
                  there for a year, but while unexpectedly back in Spain, I reconnected with a friend I had made the previous year
                  who eventually became my partner to this day, so it ended up being for the best.

               <h2>Medellin, Colombia</h2>
               <p>After a heavy year in Europe, I returned back to South America for what would be the most fun year
                  of my life. The first time had been a learning experience, but this time I was fluent and capable of
                  full integration into the culture. Colombians are the nicest people I've ever lived around. There wasn't
                  a time I went out and didn't meet someone new who wanted to be friends. Because of its geography, Colombia has a 
                  little bit of everything that South America has to offer, as it has a Caribbean coast, a Pacific coast,
                  access to the Amazon River, big cosmopolitan cities, mountain ranges, and rainforests.

               <a name="Segovia"></a>
               <h2>Segovia, Spain</h2>
               <p> In 2016, I returned to Spain and discovered my favorite place in the world.  There is 
                  this little medieval town on the other side of the mountains from Madrid. It seems unbelievable 
                  that it's not more well known, but don't tell anyone because I want it to stay as it is. It has a
                  2000 year old Roman aqueduct that cuts the city in two. From there, you can follow the main street
                  through the old town until you reach a plaza that has one of the last Gothic style cathedrals that were
                  ever constructed. At the far end of the old town, there's a castle that looks straight out of Disney.
                  To top it off, you have white cap mountains in the background. For someone who loves both history
                  and camping, Segovia is a true paradise. My long terms plans are to buy an apartement there and live out
                  my old age.

               <a name="Toledo"></a>
               <h2>Toledo, Spain</h2>
               <p>After Segovia, I tried out Toledo. It looks like a city from Game of Thrones. I don't think I'll
                  ever live in a more picturesque city, as it looks like it was designed and built all at once so 
                  that everything goes together perfectly. The small river that passes through there is the same enormous
                  river that spills out into the Atlantic in Lisbon.

               <a name="Cordoba"></a>
               <h2>Cordoba, Spain</h2>
               <p>Addicted to historical Spanish cities, I moved to Cordoba next. This is the kind of place an
                  American thinks of when they think of Spain. In the heart of Andalucia, it's hot, exotic, and 
                  features the Mudejar style that blended the Islamic and Christian medieval world. The 2000 year
                  old Roman bridge was used in Game of Thrones and the 1000 year old mosque in the center of the 
                  city is one of the wonders of the world.

            <section>
               <a name="Madrid"></a>
               <h2>Madrid, Spain</h2>
               <p>My last destination was the Spanish capital of Madrid. While not the most touristy city in Spain(Barcelona
                  and Seville are far more appetizing for a first time visitor), it's a wonderful and vibrant place 
                  to live, full of the things I like most, old bars and world class museums. I view Madrid as my hometown 
                  in Spain, as Segovia and Toledo are essentially in Madrid's orbit. This was the first time I taught elementary
                  school students. I had always taught high school and college before and was a little scared to take on the 
                  young ones. It turned out to be the best job I ever had. Their brains are like little sponges, optimized to
                  learn new language. That, and they like and want to do everything. What a delight!
